## Module-level analysis for detecting unmarked transitions.
##
## TODO: Implement detection of procs that:
## - Take a state type and return a different state type
## - Are not marked with {.transition.}
##
## This requires either:
## - A post-compilation pass
## - Integration with nim check
## - A separate analyzer tool
##
## For now, this is a placeholder for future implementation.
